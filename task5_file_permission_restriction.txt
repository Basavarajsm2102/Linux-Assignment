1. To restrict permissions on new files, configure the umask for the system. The default umask might be set to 0022, allowing users to read and execute files.

2. Set the umask value to 0777 for no permissions on new files:
   sudo nano /etc/profile
   Add the line:
   umask 0777

3. Save and exit. The umask will now apply to new files created.
4. Test by creating a new file:
   touch newfile.txt
   ls -l newfile.txt
   (Permissions should be restricted, with no access allowed to others)
