1. Create a new user named "testuser":
   sudo useradd testuser

2. Set the password for the new user:
   sudo passwd testuser

3. To ensure the user cannot use sudo, ensure they are not in the sudoers group:
   sudo deluser testuser sudo

4. Test the user's sudo access by attempting:
   su - testuser
   sudo ls
   (This should show an error that the user is not in the sudoers file)
