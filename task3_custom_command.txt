1. Create a new script to list files in the current directory when the command `describe` is executed:
   sudo nano /usr/local/bin/describe

2. Add the following content to the script:
   #!/bin/bash
   ls -l

3. Make the script executable:
   sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/describe

4. Test the script:
   describe
   (This should list files in the current directory)
